HOUSE PRICE PREDICTION
This repository contains a Python-based machine learning project for predicting house prices. Predicting house prices is a common and essential task in the real estate market, enabling buyers, sellers, and investors to make informed decisions. In this project, we utilize a dataset containing various features of houses to build and train a predictive model.

Features
Data preprocessing: Cleaning, handling missing values, and feature scaling.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing the dataset's characteristics, distributions, and correlations to gain insights.
Feature Engineering: Creating new relevant features from the existing ones to improve model performance.
Model Selection: Comparing different regression algorithms to identify the best-suited model for this prediction task.
Model Training: Training the selected model on the preprocessed dataset.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model's performance using appropriate metrics and visualizations.
Prediction: Making house price predictions using new, unseen data.


Getting Started

Clone this repository:

Navigate to the project directory:

Install the required dependencies:

Download the dataset and place it in the data directory.

Run the Jupyter notebook or Python scripts sequentially to see the step-by-step process.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project was taken from Kaggle.com contains various features that describe different aspects of houses, such as the number of bedrooms, medianhousevalue, area size, longitude,lattitude, etc. The target variable is the price of the house. The dataset is available in the data directory and is provided in CSV format.

Usage
Feel free to use this project as a template for your own house price prediction tasks. You can modify the code, experiment with different algorithms, or even extend it to include additional features or external data sources. Make sure to replace the dataset with your own data if you have a specific dataset to work with.
